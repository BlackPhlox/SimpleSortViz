Sorting algorithms by [Darinka Zobenica](https://stackabuse.com/sorting-algorithms-in-java/)

Because I was curious, I made each sort function in a seperate theard. This resulted in the array not always getting quite sorted depending on the algorithm. However, because it was made async, means that you can run as many sorting algorithms that you want on the same array. Which is quite fun to watch. Doing QuickSort quickly followed by SelectionSort, actually works quite well.
